We also have introduced a feature for people open up to the world our "secret confession " here you can open up and share anything you want without feeling insecure about people judging you as it is completely anonymous no login or any data is taken by the application so feel free to try it.

Then we have our notes section where you can open heartedly write down your mind and soul.Totally offline storage so no worries of leak or any privacy concerns.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions
that people naturally use in email.
As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.
