##  Problem Statement:

Mental health, mostly among the new generation, is starting to rise as a major issue . Where people face issues to focus, insomnia, shorter attention time to name some.

## Proposed Solution :

This app is developed keeping in mind the same, 
- The Music Section : Research shows the benefits of music therapy for various mental health conditions, including depression, trauma, and schizophrenia (to name a few).  Music acts as a medium for processing emotions, trauma, and griefâ€”but music can also be utilized as a regulating or calming agent for anxiety or for dysregulation.
- The Secrets Section : It is designed with people in mind who feel under confidence or fear of being judged with respect to those we made this section completely anonymous 
- The Notes Section : It is made to help people remember things that slip out of their mind by having it written down. It can be used as Sticky Notes or daily diary depending on personal preference.Journaling helps control your symptoms and improve your mood by
helping you prioritize problems, fears, and concerns;Tracking any symptoms day-to-day so that you can recognize triggers and learn ways to better control them;Providing an opportunity for positive self-talk and identifying negative thoughts and behaviors

## Future Scope And Update Plans

> The app is currently in further development with a small number of people currently using it and regular feedback is being collected to improve the app.

> It future the plans goes on making the app more closed, with making it a community social networking all, now as you can see the secrets feed app itâ€™s an open board where anyone can write anything, even tho we check for invalid keywords before posting still there rises problem of misuse thatâ€™s why we are planning to add auth to the all and ban users in case of misuse of app.

> We plan to add an online music player to the app but due to some issues with firebase (Storage in use) bandwidth and coding bugs issues ,we have pushed it for future updates.

> Lastly we will be adding features to notes to delete & edit individual note entries which have been skipped in this release.
